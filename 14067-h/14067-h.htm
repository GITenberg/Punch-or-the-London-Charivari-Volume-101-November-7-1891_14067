    </div>

    <p>We learn by telegraph from Berlin that some uneasiness
    exists in that capital owing to demonstrations made by the
    photographists and artists in plaster-of-Paris, who have been
    accustomed to reproduce likenesses and busts of His Imperial
    Majesty. They complain that, owing to a measure of uncertainty
    about the EMPEROR's personal appearance from day to day, they
    have large stocks thrown on their hands, and are reduced to a
    condition approaching bankruptcy. The crisis has been
    precipitated by the circumstance that, just when the combined
    trades, recovering from their first disaster, had produced a
    Christmas stock of portraits and busts, showing His Majesty
    with a beard, he shaved it off, and once more they have their
    goods returned on their hands. Prussian 3-1/2 per Cents. have
    fallen to 83-85.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>When Sir AUGUSTUS DRURIOLANUS read in the <i>Times</i> that
    Signor LAGO had been granted the QUEEN's permission to prefix
    "Royal" to his opera entertainment at the Shaftesbury Theatre,
    it gave him so great a shock that, but for the opportune
    ("opera-tune," Sir AUGUSTUS jocosely put it) arrival of Dr.
    ROBSON ROUSTEM PASHA, the shock might have had a serious
    effect.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>On Monday last, at half-past three, the King of SPAIN cut a
    new tooth, His Majesty's seventh acquisition in this class of
    property. The happy event was celebrated by a salute of
    seventeen guns.</p>

    <p>"What's that?" asked His Majesty, awakened by the roar from
    his siesta.</p>

    <p>"Sire," said the Field-Marshal commanding the troops,
    bringing his trusty Toledo to the salute, "your Majesty has
    condescended to cut a tooth."</p>

    <p>"That's all very well to begin with," said the King; "but,
    when I grow a little older, I mean to cut a dash."</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Previous to the appointment of Mr. ARTHUR BALFOUR, much
    speculation was indulged in as to the succession to the
    Leadership of the House of Commons. In Conservative circles
    there was an almost universal desire to see the place filled by
    a noble Baron well-known for the assiduity with which he
    arrives in town to transact business in Bouverie Street,
    returning to his country seat the same evening.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>During the interval after it had been made known that the
    Leadership of the House of Commons had been offered to Mr.
    BALFOUR, and whilst his decision was anxiously awaited, Sir
    WILLIAM HARCOURT was asked whether he thought the Chief
    Secretary would take the place.</p>

    <p>"Who can say, TOBY <i>mio</i>?" answered the Squire,
    stroking his chin, with a far-away glance. "The situation
    reminds me of an incident that came under my notice when I
    represented Oxford borough. One of my constituents, a worthy
    pastor, had had a call to another and much wealthier church. He
    asked for time to consider the proposal. One afternoon, a
    fortnight later, I met his son in High Street, and inquired
    whether his father had decided to take the new place. 'Well,'
    said the youngster, 'Pa is still praying for light, but most of
    the things are packed.'"</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>We understand that an innovation will be introduced at
    Guildhall on the occasion of the Lord MAYOR's dinner. The Lord
    MAYOR elect being a Welshman, intends to substitute the leek
    for the loving cup. At the stage of the festival where the
    loving cup usually goes round, a dish of leeks will be passed
    along, and every guest will be expected publicly to eat one.
    This will necessitate an alteration in the time-honoured
    formula of the Toastmaster. On the 9th of November it will run:
    "My Lords, Ladies and Gentlemen, the Right Hon. the Lord MAYOR
    pledges you with a loving leek, and bids you HALL a 'arty
    welcome."</p>

    <h2>OUR OWN FINANCIAL COLUMN.</h2>

    <h4>(<i>By Croesus.</i>)</h4>

    <blockquote class="note">
        <p>[<i>Mr. Punch</i> has decided that it is absolutely
        necessary for him to publish every week a financial
        article. The best treatises on Political Economy lay it
        down as an axiom that, where the desire for acquisition is
        universal, and the standard of value absolute, a balance
        between gain and loss can only be reached by the
        mathematical adjustment of <i>meum</i> and <i>tuum</i>.
        Acting upon this principle, <i>Mr. Punch</i> has, in the
        interests of everybody, retained the services of one of the
        most, if not <i>the</i> most, eminent contemporary
        financiers, whom modesty alone prevents from signing his
        own name to his benevolent and comprehensive articles.
        Those, however, who care to look beneath the surface, will
        have no difficulty in determining the identity of one of
        the greatest modern monetary authorities, a man whose nod
        has before this shattered prosperous empires, and whose
        word is even better than his bond, could such a thing be
        possible. <i>Mr. Punch</i> has only one thing to say to
        those who desire to be rich. It is this. Follow implicitly
        the advice of CROESUS.]</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>SIR,&mdash;You have asked me to devote some of my spare time
    to the enlightenment of your readers on matters connected with
    the money-markets of the world. The request is an easy one to
    make. You talk of spare time, as if the man who controlled
    millions of money, and could <i>at any moment</i> put all the
    Directors of the Bank of England in his waistcoat pocket, had
    absolutely nothing to do except to devote himself to the
    affairs of other people. Such a man has no leisure. When he is
    not engaged in launching loans, or in admitting to an audience
    the Prime Ministers of peoples rightly struggling to free
    themselves from debt by adding largely to their public
    liabilities, when, I say, he is not thusly or otherwisely
    engaged, his mind must still busy itself with the details of
    all the immense concerns over which he, more or less, presides.
    However, I am willing to make an exception in your case, and to
    impart to you the ripe fruits of an experience which has no
    parallel in any country of the habitable globe. Without,
    therefore, cutting any more time to waste, I begin.</p>

    <div class="figright"
         style="width:14%;">
        <a href="images/217-2.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/217-2.png"
             alt="" /></a>
    </div>

    <p>(1.) <i>Mines</i>.&mdash;There can be no doubt that in this
    department a largely increased activity may soon be expected. I
    am aware that in "Shafts" there has been a downward tendency;
    but I am assured by the Secretary of the "Dodjâ Plant Co."
    (19-1/2, 6/8, 54·2-1/2, 7/8), that the prospects of this branch
    of investment were never more brilliant. The latest report of
    the Mining Expert sent out to investigate this mine, runs as
    follows:&mdash;</p>

    <p>"I have now been three days in the interior of the Dodjâ
    Plant. I can confidently state that I found no water, though
    there was evidence of large deposits of salt, which could be
    worked at an immense profit. The gold is abundant. I have
    crushed ten tons of quartz <i>with my own hands</i>, and found
    the yield in florins extraordinary. The natives guard the mouth
    of the mine. Please relieve promptly. My assistant became a
    Salmi yesterday."</p>

    <p>There is some obscurity (intentional, of course) in the last
    few words. I may, therefore, state that a Salmi is one of the
    most important native bankers. The profession is only open to
    millionnaires. I therefore say, emphatically, buy Dodjâs.</p>

    <p>(2.) <i>The Carbon Diamond Fields</i>.&mdash;The latest
    quotations are 14-5/8 to the dozen, with irregular falls.
    Carbon Prefs. unaltered. Trusts firm. This is a good investment
    for a poor man. In fact there could not be a better. No
    necessity to deal through an ordinary stockbroker. Wire
    "CROESUS, City." That will find me, and by return you shall
    have address of banker, to whom first deposit for cover must be
    immediately paid.</p>

    <p>(3.) <i>Italian Cattivas</i> quieter. A Correspondent
    asks&mdash;"What do you recommend a man who has laid by £20 to
    do in order to hold £1,000 at the end of a month?" I say at
    once, Try Cattivas (19-2/5 Def.; Deb. Stk. 14&mdash;15). Wire
    "CROESUS, City."</p>

    <p>(4.) <i>South-African Pih Kroost</i> short. Gold continues
    to be in good demand. Anybody wishing to make a quick profit
    out of a small sum, such as from two to five sovereigns, wire
    "CROESUS, City" anytime before 12·30. In all cases of
    telegraphing, the message must be "Reply-Paid," or no notice
    will be taken of the communication. Remember "Time is Money."
    Keep up a good supply of both, and you'll live to bless
    "CROESUS."</p>

    <p><i>Advice Gratis</i>.&mdash;Make (Brighton) "A," while the
    sun shines,</p>

    <p>Inquiries as to <i>The Para Docks Company</i>, and <i>The
    Jerrie Myer Bilder Company</i>, I will answer squarely and
    fairly next week. Don't move in these without the straight and
    direct advice of "CROESUS."</p>

    <p>As to the <i>Turpin, Sheppard, and Abershaw Highways
    Company</i>, I shall have something to say next week. Investors
    who want a real good thing, just hold your coin in hand for a
    week, till I say "Go," and then go it. This Company will be a
    big thing, <i>and, mind you, safe</i>.</p>

    <p>For the present I close the account, to re-open it next
    week, and, to show my good faith, send you my subscription,
    which you may read here, as I subscribe myself, "CROESUS,
    CITY."</p>

    <p>What a prowd and appy day dear old Whales is about for to
    have on the werry next Lord Mare's Day, as is cumming, which
    it's the ninth of nex month, which it's nex Monday. Not only is
    wun of the werry populusest of living Welchmen a going for to
    be made Lord MARE on that werry day, but the Prince of WHALES
    hisself, who was inwited but karnt kum cos he's keepin' his
    hone Jewbilly at ome that appy and horspigious day. Praps Madam
    HADDYLEANER PATTY (wich is quite a Welch name) would kum up an
    give us a treat on this okashun.</p>

    <p>Praps my enthewsiasm in the cause of Whales may be xcused
    when I reweals the fack that I am myself arf a Welchman, as my
    Mother was a reel one before me, and so, strange to say, was my
    Huncle, her Brother. There was sum idear of dressing me up as a
    Bard with a Arp, and I was to jine in when the rest on us
    struck up "<i>The March of the Men of Garlick</i>," but I
    prudently declined the temting horffer. I need scarcely say
    that Welch Rabbits will be a werry striking part of the Maynoo,
    being probably substituted for the Barrens of Beef.</p>

    <p>I'm told as all the Ministers is a cumming.</p>

    <p>BROWN, with his ushal raddicle imperence, says it's becoz
    they knos as it's for the larst time. Yes, much BROWN knos
    about it, when he sed jest the werry same thing larst year! I'm
    told as Mr. BALFOUR and Mr. GOSHEN is to be seated nex to each
    other, so that they can take the Loving Cup together. So that
    will be all rite. We are going to have a splendid
    Persession&mdash;the werry longest and the werry
    hinterestingest of moddern times! So I adwise all my many kyind
    paytrons and Country Cuzzins to "<i>cum erly</i>." There's no
    telling what dredful changes may take place in these horful
    rewolushunary times, and ewen the "Sacred Sho" may be stript of
    sum of its many attrackshuns, or ewen erbolished altogether!
    But that is, of course, only a fearfool wision, begotten, as
    SHAKSPEARE says, of too much supper last nite, "a praying on my

    <p>A CHILI PICKLE.&mdash;The following advertisement is sent

    <p>If Chilians can treat English like this, Americans will
    stand a poor chance "<i>against rent or board to a

    would probably "afford employment for the gentlemen of the long

    I who believed you capable of appreciating such devotion as

    <p><i>A Voice behind</i>. My! If I don't know that back I'll

    <p><i>Miss Trotter</i>. Well, we came up on the cars in front
    of yours. We've taken rooms at the hotel up here. Poppa
    reckoned the air would be kind of fresher on the top of this
    mountain, and I don't believe but what he's right either. I
    guess I shall want another hairpin through <i>my</i> hat. And
    are you still going around with Mr. PODBURY? As inseparable as
    ever, I presume?</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> Er&mdash;<i>about</i> as inseparable. That is,
    we are still travelling together&mdash;only, on this particular
    afternoon&mdash;</p>

    <p><i>Miss T.</i> He went and got mislaid? I see. He used to
    stray considerable over in Germany, didn't he? Well, I'm real
    pleased to see <i>you</i> anyway. And how's the poetry been
    panning out? I hope you've had a pretty good yield of
    sonnets?</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> (<i>to himself</i>). She's really grown
    distinctly prettier. She might show a little more
    <i>feeling</i>, though, considering we were almost, if not
    quite&mdash;(<i>Aloud.</i>) So you remember my poor poems? I'm
    afraid I have not been very&mdash;er&mdash;prolific of
    late.</p>

    <p><i>Miss T.</i> You don't say! I should think you'd have had
    one to show for every day, with the date to it, like a new-laid
    egg.</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> Birds don't lay&mdash;er&mdash;I mean they
    don't <i>sing</i>, in the dark. My light has
    been&mdash;er&mdash;lacking of late.</p>

    <p><i>Miss T.</i> If that's intended for me, you ought to begin
    chirping right away. But you're not going to tell me you've
    been "lounjun round en sufferin'" like&mdash;wasn't it <i>Uncle
    Remus's</i> Brer Terrapin? (<i>Catching</i> C.'s <i>look of
    bewilderment.</i>) What, don't you know <i>Uncle Remus</i>?</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> (<i>politely</i>). Mr. TROTTER is the only
    relation of yours I have had the pleasure of meeting, as
    yet.</p>

    <p><i>Miss T.</i> Why, I reckoned <i>Uncle Remus</i> was pretty
    most everybody's relation by now. He's a book. But likely
    you've no use for our national humorous literature?</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> I&mdash;er&mdash;must confess I seldom waste
    time over the humorous literature of <i>any</i> nation.</p>

    <p><i>Miss T.</i> I guess that accounts for your gaiety! There,
    don't you mind <i>me</i>, Mr. CULCHARD. But suppose we hurry
    along and inspect this panorama they talk so much of; it isn't
    going to be any sideshow. It's just a real representative
    mass-meeting of Swiss mountains, with every prominent peak in
    the country on the platform, and a deputation down below from
    the leading Italian lakes. It's ever so elegant,&mdash;and
    there's Poppa around on the top too.</p>

    <h4><i>On the top. Tourists discovered making more or less
    appropriate remarks.</i></h4>

    <p><i>First Tourist</i> (<i>struggling with a long printed
    panorama, which flaps like a sail</i>). Grand view, Sir, get
    'em all from here, you see! Monte Rosa, Matterhorn,
    Breithorn&mdash;</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[<i>Works through them all conscientiously, until, much to
        everybody's relief, his panorama escapes into space.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Second T.</i> (<i>a lady, with the air of a person making
    a discovery</i>). How wonderfully small everything looks down
    below!</p>

    <p><i>Third T.</i> (<i>a British Matron, with a talent for
    incongruity</i>). Yes, dear, very&mdash;<i>quite</i> worth
    coming all this way for, but as I was telling you, we've always
    been accustomed to such an evangelical service, so that our new
    Rector is really <i>rather</i>&mdash;but we're quite
    <i>friendly</i> of course; go there for tennis, and he dines
    with us, and all that. Still, I <i>do</i> think, when it comes
    to having lighted candles in broad daylight&mdash;(&amp;c.,
    &amp;c.)</p>

    <p><i>Fourth T.</i> (<i>an equally incongruous American</i>).
    Wa'al, yes, they show up well, cert'nly, those peaks do. But I
    was about to remark. Sir, I went to that particular
    establishment on Fleet Street. I called for a chop. And when it
    came, I don't deny I felt disappointed, for the plate all
    around was just as <i>dry</i>&mdash;! But the moment I struck a
    fork into that chop, Sir,&mdash;well, the way the gravy just
    came <i>gushing</i> out was&mdash;there, it ain't no use me
    trying to put it in words! But from that instant, Sir, I kinder
    realised the peculiar charm of your British chop.</p>

    <p><i>Fifth T.</i> (<i>a discontented Teuton</i>). I exbected
    more as zis. It is nod glear enough&mdash;nod at all. Zey dolt
    me from ze dop you see Milan. I look all aroundt. Novere I see
    Milan! And I lief my obera-glass behint me in ze drain, and I
    slib on ze grass and sbrain my mittle finger, and altogedder I
    do not vish I had com.</p>

    <p><i>Miss T.</i> (<i>presenting</i> CULCHARD <i>to</i> Mr.
    CYRUS K.T.). I guess you've met <i>this</i> gentleman
    before!</p>

    <p><i>Mr. T.</i> Well now, that's <i>so</i>. I didn't just
    reckon I'd meet him again all this way above the sea-level
    though, but I'm just as pleased to see him. Rode up on the
    cars, I presume, Sir? Tolerable hilly road all the way,
    <i>ain't</i> it now? There cann't anybody say we hain' made the
    most of <i>our</i> time since you left us. Took a run over to
    Berlin; had two hours and a haff in that city, and I dunno as I
    keered about making a more pro-tracted visit. Went right
    through to Vi-enna, saw round Vi-enna. I did want, being so
    near, to just waltz into Turkey and see that. But I guess
    Turkey'll have to keep till next time. Then back again into
    Switzerland, for I do seem to have kinder taken a fancy to
    Switzerland. I'd like to have put in more time there, and we
    stayed best part of a week too! But Italy's an interesting
    place. Yes, I'm getting considerable interested in Italy, so
    far as I've got. There's Geneva now&mdash;</p>

    <p><i>Miss T.</i> You do beat anything for mixing up places,
    Father. And you don't want to be letting yourself loose on Mr.
    CULCHARD this way. You'd better go and bring Mr. VAN BOODELER
    along; he's round somewhere.</p>

    <p><i>Mr. T.</i> I do like slinging off when I meet a friend;
    but I'll shut down, MAUD, I'll shut down.</p>

    <p><i>Miss T.</i> Oh, there you are, CHARLEY! Come right here,
    and be introduced to Mr. CULCHARD. He's a vurry intelligent
    man. My cousin, Mr. CHARLES VAN BOODELER,&mdash;Mr. CULCHARD.
    Mr. VAN BOODELER's intelligent too. He's going to write our
    great National Amurrcan novel, soon as ever he has time for it.
    That's so, isn't it?</p>

    <p><i>Mr. V.B.</i> (<i>a slim, pale young man, with a
    cosmopolitan air and a languid drawl</i>). It's our most
    pressing national need, Sir, and I have long cherished the
    intention of supplying it. I am collecting material, and, when
    the psychological moment arrives, I shall write that novel. And
    I believe it will be a big thing, a very big thing; I mean to
    make it a complete compendium of every phase of our great and
    complicated civilisation from State to State and from shore to
    shore. [CULCHARD <i>bows vaguely.</i></p>

    <p><i>Miss T.</i> Yes, and the great Amurrcan public are going
    to rise up in their millions and boom it. Only I don't believe
    they'd better start booming just yet, till there's something
    more than covers to that novel. And how you're going to collect
    material for an Amurrcan novel, flying round Europe, just beats
    <i>me</i>!</p>

    <p><i>Mr. V.B.</i> (<i>with superiority</i>). Because you don't
    realise that it's precisely in Europe that I find my best
    American types. Our citizens show up better against a European
    background,&mdash;it excites and stimulates their nationality,
    so to speak. And again, with a big subject like mine, you want
    to step back to get the proper focus. Now I'm <i>stepping</i>
    back.</p>

    <p><i>Miss T.</i> I guess it's more like skipping, CHARLEY. But
    so long as you're having a good time! And here's Mr. CULCHARD
    will fix <span class="pagenum"><a name="page221"
       id="page221"></a>[pg 221]</span> you up some sonnets for
       headings to the chapters. You needn't begin <i>right</i>
       away, Mr. CULCHARD; I guess there's no hurry. But we get
       talking and <i>talking</i>, and never look at anything. I
       don't call it encouraging the scenery, and that's a
       fact!</p>

    <p><i>Mr. T.</i> (<i>later, to</i> CULCHARD). And you're pretty
    comfortable at your hotel? Well, I dunno, after all, what there
    is to keep <i>us</i> here. I guess we'll go down again and stop
    at Lugano, eh, MAUD?</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[CULCHARD <i>eagerly awaits her reply.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Miss T.</i> I declare! After bringing all my trunks way
    up here! But I'd just as soon move down as not; they're not
    unpacked any. (<i>Joy of</i> C.) Seems a pity, too, after
    engaging rooms here. And they looked real nice. Mr. CULCHARD,
    don't you and Mr. PODBURY want to come up here and take them?
    They've a perfectly splendid view, and then we could have
    yours, you know! (C. <i>cannot conceal his chagrin at this
    suggestion.</i>) Well, see here, Poppa, we'll go along and try
    if we can't square the hotel-clerk and get our baggage on the
    cars again, and then we'll see just how we feel about it. I'm
    perfectly indifferent either way.</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> (<i>to himself, as he follows</i>). Can she be
    really as indifferent as she seems? I'm afraid she has very
    little heart! But if only she can be induced to go back to
    Lugano ... She will be at the same hotel&mdash;a great point! I
    wish that fellow VAN BOODELER wasn't coming too, though ... Not
    that they've settled to come at all yet!... Still, I fancy she
    likes the idea ... She'll come&mdash;if I don't appear too
    anxious about it! [<i>He walks on, trying to whistle

    <h2>WAR IN A FOG.</h2>

    <h4>(<i>A Record of the Next Campaign of the Coming
    Moltke.</i>)</h4>

    <p>Our Army was now advancing in good order. We had the "A"
    Division of the enemy on our right, and the "B" Division on our
    left, but of course we had lost sight of Division "C." It was
    the morning after we had taken the fortress that had
    unexpectedly appeared before us on our right front, and had
    found ourselves to our surprise by the side of a river. The
    Chief of my Staff entered my tent whilst I was engaged in
    studying a map not very successfully.</p>

    <div class="figleft"
         style="width:30%;">
        <a href="images/221-1.png"><img width="100%"

    <p>"General," said he, "military music can be heard in the
    distance, from which I take it it must be the other part of our
    Army." "This is most fortunate," I replied; "but are they
    supposed to be in this part of the country? I fancied they were
    besieging the enemy's metropolis.</p>

    <p>"So it was reported," returned my subordinate; "but it
    appears that, taking the first turning to the right, instead of
    the second to the left, they lost their way, and instead of
    capturing the capital, surrounded a harbour, in which, to their
    astonishment, they found his fleet."</p>

    <p>"I suppose that the movements of Division 'C' are shrouded
    in mystery?"</p>

    <p>"They are," returned the Chief of the Staff, saluting. "It
    is presumed that the commander is wandering somewhere near the
    frontier. A spy from his Army says that he had entirely lost
    touch of the country, and was continually asking his way. But
    how about our friends, the remainder of our Army, who are now
    approaching towards us? What shall we do?"</p>

    <p>"Give them a fitting reception," was my reply.</p>

    <p>In a moment our Army halted and pitched their tents.
    Accustomed to State functions of every sort and description, it
    was no difficult matter to them to decorate the line of march
    appropriately. Suddenly there was the sound of firing, and five
    minutes later an officer wearing the uniform of the enemy
    entered my tent and surrendered his sword.</p>

    <p>"General," said he, "I yield to your superior knowledge of
    military tactics. I had expected to find friends, and now I
    have come across foes. And you number more than half a million
    of men, do you not?"</p>

    <p>"Well, no; you may mean my brother commander, who has that
    force under his orders. But we have only about twenty
    thousand."</p>

    <p>"And I have given up my arms for nothing," said my
    visitor.</p>

    <p>"To whom have I the honour of speaking?" I asked, haughtily.
    "I presume, the Captain of the 'A' Division?"</p>

    <p>"The 'A' Division! Why, they are miles away! and so are the
    'B' Division."</p>

    <p>"Then, who on earth are you?"</p>

    <p>"Why, surely you know we are the 'C' Division?"</p>

    <p>At this moment the Chief of my Staff again appeared. "Sir,"
    said he, "are we to advance or retire? I must know at once,
    with a view to arranging satisfactorily the requirements of the
    Commissariat."</p>

    <p>"One moment, Gentlemen," I replied, and then entered an
    inner recess. I searched my pockets, and finding my tossing
    half-crown, spun it into the air. I eagerly ascertained the
    result.</p>

    <p>"We will advance, Sir," said I to the Chief of the Staff on
    my return. And my tone suggested both strong determination and
    peremptory command.</p>

    <h2>THE IDLE AND THE INDUSTRIOUS APPRENTICE.</h2>

    <h4>(<i>An Old-fashioned Apologue with a Modern
    Application.</i>)</h4>

    <p>GRANDOLH and ARTHUR were two young Apprentices, bound
    betimes to the ingenious and estimable Art or Craft of
    <i>Cabinet-Making</i>. Both of them were youths of a Sprightly
    Genius, and of an Alert Apprehension, attended, in the case of
    GRANDOLPH, with a mighty heat and ebullition of Fancy, which
    led early to a certain frothiness or ventosity in speech.
    ARTHUR, on the other hand, though possessed of excellent Parts,
    appeared to be of a more phlegmatic temperament, and took on a
    more languorous, not to say saturnine demeanour.</p>

    <p>So it came about that for the time GRANDOLPH seemed to carry
    it over his fellow Apprentice, who indeed, amongst superficial
    observers, incurred the reproach of indolence and lackadaisical
    indifference, and although both were of creditable repute in
    the <i>Craft</i>, yet did GRANDOLPH shine the more prominently
    and give the greater promise of pre-eminence, ARTHUR seeming
    content, as men say, to <i>play second fiddle</i> to the more
    pushing Performer.</p>

    <p>'Tis, however, within the purview of the Wise and the common
    observation of the Judicious, that <i>things are not always as
    they seem!</i></p>

    <p>GRANDOLPH, at an early epoch in his Apprenticeship, did
    found a sort of Comradeny or Free Company, which, from the
    number of its constituent items, came to be intituled <i>The
    Fourth Party</i>, in the which ARTHUR modestly took subordinate
    place, with unobtrusive ease and languid resignation. This
    Party did push matters in the <i>Craft</i> with a high hand and
    a talkative tongue. For as the ingenious Earl of SHAFTESBURY
    saith in his <i>Soliloquy</i>, "Company is an extreme
    provocative to Fancy, and, like a hot bed in gardening, is apt
    to make our Imaginations sprout too fast."</p>

    <p>That GRANDOLPH was obnoxious to this charge of "sprouting
    too fast" may seem made manifest by the sequel. He indeed
    pushed himself into the front place by dint of copious
    verbosity, and militant oppugnancy. But (as the same
    SHAFTESBURY saith) where, instead of Controul, Debate, or
    Argument, the chief exercise of the wit consists in
    uncontroulable Harangues and Reasonings, which must neither be
    questioned nor contradicted; there is great danger lest the
    Party, thro' this habit, shou'd suffer much by Cruditys,
    Indigestions, Choler, bile, and particularly by a certain
    <i>tumour</i>, or <i>flatulency</i>, which renders him, of all
    men, the least liable to apply the wholesome <i>regimen</i> of
    self-practice. 'Tis no wonder if such quaint practitioners grow
    to an enormous size of Absurdity, whilst they continue the
    reverse of that practice, by which alone we correct the
    Redundancy of Humours, and chasten the exuberance of Conceit
    and Fancy.</p>

    <p>Whether this particular "quaint practitioner" (our Idle
    Apprentice, GRANDOLPH) plagued "the Party" too much with his
    "Cruditys, Choler," &amp;c., or whether he found himself unable
    to correct his own "Redundancy of Humours," certain it is that,
    at the very Pinnacle of Promise, and Height of Achievement,
    GRANDOLPH broke his indentures of Apprenticeship, and <i>ran
    away!</i></p>

    <p>And now, indeed, came the Opportunity of the true
    Industrious Apprentice, the hitherto calm and languid-looking,
    but, in verity, valorous, and vigilant, and virile ARTHTUR.
    Whereof, to be sure, he made abundant use, burgeoning forth
    into full blossom with astonishing suddenness, seizing
    Opportunity by the forelock with manly promptitude, and gaining
    golden opinions from all sorts of people; so that, after brief
    probation, he slipped, by general acclaim, into that very
    premier place so strangely, suddenly, and intempestively
    abdicated by the Idle Apprentice, GRANDOLPH.</p>

    <p>Concerning the latter, the latest reports are not
    reassuring. Like his celebrated prototype of fable, the
    ill-fated "Don't Care," he runneth a chance of being "devoured
    by lions"! At least he appears to have sought the company of
    those parlous beasts in their <i>native Afric wilds</i>. We
    hear that "the lions kept him tucked up one night," which same
    news (&mdash;gathered from a diurnal intituled the Johannesberg
    <i>Star</i>&mdash;) hath a fearsome and ill-boding sound. That
    he is&mdash;for the time at least&mdash;in every sense "tucked
    up," is only too obviously true. Peradventure he may yet think
    the better of it, correct his Frothy Distemper and Vagrant
    Disposition, and (as the agonising advertisements have it)
    return to his friends that all may be forgiven and much
    forgotten!</p>

    <p>But the last accounts of him picture him as lying languidly
    asprawl <span class="pagenum"><a name="page223"
       id="page223"></a>[pg 223]</span> upon a Mausoleum in
       Mashonaland, <i>playing dice with himself!</i> The tomb
       would indeed appear to be, in the sombre words of the
       Mystick Poet:&mdash;</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"The vault of his lost Ulalume,"</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>the runic-sounding word, "Ulalume," being taken perchance as
    the African synonym for "Reputation." Whether the cheering word
    <i>Resurgam</i> will ever be appropriate to <i>that</i> Tomb
    remaineth to be seen. But it would appear only too plain that
    GRANDOLPH (in the words of the aforesaid SHAFTESBURY) "hath
    been a great frequenter of the woods and river-banks, where he
    hath consum'd abundance of his breath, suffer'd his Fancy to
    evaporate, and reduc'd the vehemence both of his Spirit and
    Voice." In short, that the erst ambitious and aspiring
    GRANDOLPH is still content, for the time at least, to play the
    part of <i>The Idle Apprentice</i>.</p>

    dramatic scenes <i>In Cambridge Courts</i>, by Mr. LEHMANN. The

    Mightily disappointed is the Baron with Mr. J.H. SHORTHOUSE's

    <h2>QUERIES FOR CANDIDATES (L.C.C.)</h2>

    <h4>(<i>What they may come to.</i>)</h4>

    <p>As the County Council now has power over the Tramways of
    London, will you pledge yourself to see that smoking carriages,
    comfortable cushions, waiting-rooms at street-corners, and
    constant civility, are provided for passengers?</p>

    <p>Will you abolish the irritating and nefarious Ticket
    System?</p>

    <p>How long do you think it will be before the electric light
    is universally established in the cars?</p>

    <p>What is your view as to the provision of suitable places for
    wet umbrellas?</p>

    <p>Will you at once vote for "Free or Assisted Locomotion"?</p>

    <p>If a wheel of your private carriage comes off owing to
    skidding in the Tramway line, will you pledge yourself not to
    bring any claim for compensation against the Rates?</p>

    <p>Will you vote for the summary dismissal of any Conductor who
    proceeds to count the passengers after being informed that he
    is "full inside"?</p>

    <p>Is it a fact that you have promised to introduce "Pullman
    Palace Restaurant Cars, with free lunches," on the Tram-lines?
    If so, do you contemplate providing the cost out of your own
    resources, or how?</p>

    <p>You state in your Address to the Electors that you "are
    desirous of reducing the hours of Tram <i>employés</i> to four
    a day, with two months' holiday in the year, and of giving a
    general rise of wages up to about £2 extra per week." Will you
    kindly say how you reconcile this desire with your expressed
    intention to "run the concern on the most economical plan, so
    as to save the pockets of the Ratepayers"?</p>

    <p>It is reported that you have pledged yourself, if elected,
    to see that the Tram Conductors "get their Saturday to Monday
    at Brighton as a regular thing." How do you propose to carry
    out this part of your programme?</p>

    <p>Do you consider yourself justified, in face of the above
    statements, in characterising the rival Candidate for the
    Council as "attempting to catch the Labour Vote by an impudent
    combination of insincere flattery, and fraudulent
    promises"?</p>

    <p>"The 'Arwarden Old 'Un, Gemmen? Lor bless yer, <i>he</i>
    ain't no account, nohow. Can't 'it a 'ole in a pound o' butter,
    <i>'e</i> can't. Allus <i>was</i> a muff and a muddler;
    middling showy style, and a bit dodgy with his dooks, but
    neither a slogger <i>nor</i> a stayer, and, atween you and me
    and the post, allus ready to hist the white feather when 'ard
    pressed. Wot's that you say? <i>His</i> 'Travelling Company'? A
    reglar swindle, and a fair frost, Gemmen. Went 'round the
    country' on false purtences, and never did no good nowheres.
    Awful poor lot o' Pugs, <i>that</i> gang. Not in it with the
    ''Atfield Combination Troupe,' as <i>can</i> fight a bit, and
    'as some smart scrappers in it. No, Gemmen, the 'Old 'Un'
    <i>allus were</i> a fraud. Couldn't stand up to a Froggy,
    <i>'e</i> couldn't. His Company muddled the 'ole bag o' tricks,
    and made a hawful mess of it. Ah, and <i>would</i> agen, mark
    yer, if they got the chance. Should a'most like to see 'em
    <i>'ave</i> another shy, if only for the bloomin' fun o' the
    thing; but it 'ud be a bit too expensive, and bring discredit
    on our Noble Hart, besides."</p>

    <p>(<i>Comments of the I.B.H. "Brayco, Brummagem Bantam! His
    style of hitting is straight and smart, in the ring or out of
    it. Hope the over-rated Hawardian Old 'Un and his Company
    relish the pepper young JOE has administered to the shifty
    Veteran and his parasitic 'Items'!"</i>)</p>

    <h4>II.&mdash;<i>From the "Newcastle Nobbler," alias "Honest
    JOHN."</i></h4>

    <p>"Werry much surprised to see as that windictive Bounder, the
    'Brummagem Bantam,' has bin a letting out wicious like at his
    old pals, the 'Arwarden Old 'Un and his Pugilistic Company.
    '<i>They</i> was muffs and muddlers,' he sez. Well, he ought to
    ha' said 'we,' considerin' as <i>he wos one on 'em</i>!!! The
    Old 'Un was his first patron, and me and other members of the
    Company his pertikler pals, and <i>then</i> he used for to
    crack us all up sky-high. <i>Now</i> he rounds on us for
    'making a mess of it.' Well, praps if <i>all</i> wos
    knowed&mdash;but no matter! Only, to quarrel with your old
    pals, and then go about a-sneerin' and a-jeerin' at them for
    wot you yerself wos a party to, <i>I</i> call 'hitting below
    the belt'"!</p>

    <p>(<i>Comments of the I.B.H. "Bosh! 'Honest JOHN' is a shrew,
    and not a Practical Pug. Is one prizefighter never to criticise
    another's style because he's once been in the same Company with
    him? Might as well say he must therefore never improve his own
    style. Besides, any stick is good enough to beat the Grand Old
    Pug-dog with!"</i>)</p>

    <h4>III.&mdash;<i>Rejoinder of the "Brummagem Bantam."</i></h4>

    <p>"'Itting below the belt be jolly well blowed! Honest JOHN
    don't believe a word 'e sez&mdash;it's ony his narsty spite.
    Makes hisself the wiaduck for the 'Arwarden Gang's witrol and
    winegar, <i>e</i>' do. In course I wos one o' the Old 'Un's
    Company, wus luck! But I've larned a bit since then. Wot do
    <i>you</i> think? When I larruped my old pals, and called 'em
    mugs, messers, and muddlers, in corse I included myself,
    tacit-like. <i>But there was no call for to say so!</i> As to
    not showing of 'em up acos I wos one of
    'em&mdash;Wal<i>ker</i>!!! If <i>that's</i> the Newcastle
    Nobbler's 'theory' of fair-play, 'e may jest go 'ome and eat
    coke!"</p>

    <p>(<i>Comments of the I.B.H. "The B.B. is quite right. If a
    Pug may not round on his old pals for doing what he helped them
    to do, it follows that he himself must never try to do better.
    Which is absurd! Go it, JOE!"</i>)</p>

    <h4>IV.&mdash;<i>Surrejoinder from "Honest JOHN."</i></h4>

    <p>"My 'theory' ain't a bit wot the B.B. says it is. My
    'theory' is that it's mean, and unfair, and unperfessional to
    curry favour with one's present backers by 'olding hup one's
    old pals to public redicule for doing wot we 'elped 'em to do,
    and at the time praised 'em <i>for</i> doin'. I call that
    'hitting below the belt!' And I believe every 'onest and manly
    Pug from FIGG to SAYERS would ha' said ditter to ''Onest JOHN.'
    That's all, Gemmen!"</p>

    <p>(<i>Comment of the I.B.H. "Bosh! JOE's style of hitting is
    no doubt uncomfortable&mdash;for the Old 'Un and his pals.
    THAT'S EXACTLY WHY WE LIKE IT! What's the use of hitting above
    the belt only when the foe's only vulnerable below it? We
    rejoice to see the B.B. knocking the sawdust out of the Grand
    Old Fistic Fetish, and squelching the cant and claptrap out of
    'Honest JOHN.'"</i>)</p>

    <h2>STORICULES.</h2>

    <h3>VII.&mdash;GAZEY.</h3>

    <p>"You're the fust pineter whort I've knowed," said JULIA
    SANBY, demurely. "Father works at a plumber's, but 'e ain't
    industr'us. 'E ain't a good man. An' mother drinks. Orful!"</p>

    <p>JULIA SANBY had consented, in consideration of money
    received, to let me make a sketch of her. She was a tall thin
    child, with a dirty and very intelligent face, great grey eyes,
    and long reddish hair. She was very bright and talkative; and
    yet she amazed me by being distinctly sanctimonious. She looked
    critically round my studio on her entrance.</p>

    <div class="figleft"
         style="width:30%;">
        <a href="images/228-1.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/228-1.png"
             alt="Gazey." /></a>
    </div>

    <p>"You ain't got no tex' 'ung up," she remarked,
    disparagingly. "We 'as two tex' in our kitching. I 'ung 'em up
    myself. An' father beat me for it. But I didn't keer, 'cos I
    knew I wos doin' good."</p>

    <p>She pressed her thin lips together, and looked like a
    mangled martyr.</p>

    <p>"Do you go to Sunday School?" I asked, as I got to work.</p>

    <p>"I goes reggler, an' I'm first in the School, and I knows
    more colics than any of 'em, excep' teachers. I ain't like
    GAZEY."</p>

    <p>"Who's GAZEY?"</p>

    <p>"She's a girl what I 'ites. She's a bad girl. We calls 'er
    GAZEY, 'cos it's short for GEHAZI; but that ain't 'er real
    nime. She's a liar. She's allus tellin' lies&mdash;seems as if
    she couldn't storp doin' it." JULIA SANBY sighed sadly.</p>

    <p>"What kind of lies?"</p>

    <p>"She don't tell no lies to get 'erself out of nothin'; 'cos
    she's so bad that she don't keer whort rows she gets inter. But
    she tells other sorts. She just sits up on the fence what goes
    roun' the green, an' mikes up things, an' a lot of the children
    ain't got no more sense than to sit roun' an' listen to 'er.
    That just mikes 'er worse. She sits theer, a-tellin' stories,
    an' sweerin' they're all true. You never 'eard such
    stories."</p>

    <p>"What are they all about?"</p>

    <p>"Mostly about gran' things an' wunnerful things&mdash;kings,
    an' carridges, an' angels, an' firewux, an' dreams what she
    says she's 'ad. An' she'll sweer they're true. My word, it is
    wicked of 'er! She's allus pretennin' to be things what she
    ain't, too. One Sat'dy arf'noon she said she was a steam-injun.
    An' she got 'old of a little boy, BOB COLLINGS, and said 'e was
    the tender. An' BOB COLLINGS 'ad to foller close be'ind 'er all
    that arf'noon, else she'd a' nigh killed 'im. 'E got rather
    tired, because she kept runnin' about, bein' a express an'
    'avin' cerlishuns. Lawst of all she wived 'er awms about, and
    mide a kind o' whooshin' noise. 'Now,' she said, 'my biler's
    bust, an' I'm done for!' So she lay flat on the wet groun', an'
    the tender went 'ome to 'is tea."</p>

    <p>"What's she like to look at?"</p>

    <p>JULIA SANBY confessed, with apparent reluctance, that GAZEY
    was very pretty. "She's prettier nor I am, nor any of the other
    childrun roun' 'ere. She's got golding 'air, an' blue eyes. But
    I 'ite 'er, 'cos she's so bad, an' 'cos she mikes the other
    children bad. I don't never listen to none of 'er mike-ups
    now."</p>

    <p>"Would she let me make a sketch of her?"</p>

    <p>"Dunno. You wouldn't like 'er. She's low in the wye she
    talks. The new curick don't like 'er. Nobody don't like
    'er."</p>

    <p>Now, just in this sentence, I fancied that the
    sanctimoniousness of JULIA SANBY had become mixed with some
    real feeling. I also reflected on the fact that, although most
    children are egoists, JULIA SANBY seemed to take more pleasure
    in talking about GAZEY than in discussing herself. I had
    distinct suspicions.</p>

    <p>"Could you remember any of GAZEY's stories?"</p>

    <p>"Might, p'raps."</p>

    <p>"Go on, then. Tell me one."</p>

    <p>She began a story, which was obviously an improvisation,
    with little incidents taken from other stories added to it. It
    was full of the wildest imaginings. She told it without the
    least nervousness or embarrassment. Her assumption of
    demureness and sanctity vanished utterly. She became vivid and
    dramatic. "An' I'd tike my gorspil oath it's all true," she
    added, at the conclusion, as if from force of habit.</p>

    <p>"JULIA SANBY," I said, "GAZEY has not got golden hair nor
    blue eyes, neither is she pretty. <i>You</i> are GAZEY."</p>

    <p>"I swear I ain't. I'm a good girl, and knows my colics;
    GAZEY's something orful."</p>

    <p>"Very well," I answered, and went on finishing the sketch,
    as though I took no interest in her. After a few seconds'
    silence, she added, quite calmly,</p>

    <p>"Owdjer know? I can pretend proper, cawn't I? But I 'adn't
    never talked about myself as if I was someone else afore. That
    pickshur ain't much like me."</p>

    <p>"It will be when it's finished. Come to-morrow at the same
    time."</p>

    <p>"Do you think I'm a liar?"</p>

    <p>"You're either a liar or an artist, but I'm not sure
    which."</p>

    <p>GAZEY put on her exceedingly frowsy hat. "The new curick
    needn't a bin so cock-sure about it then. G'mornin'."</p>

    <p>DEAREST DARLING MOTHER,</p>

    <p>I was so glad to get the hamper, and it has done me much
    good, all the fellows were pleased with the cake, and the
    sardines were first-rate, and the potted stuffs were awfully
    good. I am sorry you forgot the bottles of acidulated drops,
    but you can send them in the next hamper as soon as you like.
    There are only sixty-two days to the holidays&mdash;1688 hours
    including nights! Isn't that jolly!</p>

    <p>And now, my dear Mother, I want to write most seriously to
    you upon a matter of great importance. You know I have been
    doing "Music" as an "extra." Well, it does not agree with me.
    The fact is, it is an hour every week in my playtime, when the
    Doctor says it is good for my health that I should be enjoying
    myself. And "Music" is an extra, like "Sausages for breakfast."
    And, of course, one has to think of all that. How hard dear
    Papa works to get his living; and, of course, I oughtn't to
    waste anything, ought I? Well, I really think I could give up
    "Music." After all, it's awful rot, and only fit for a pack of
    girls! So this is the great favour I'm going to ask
    you&mdash;and mind you say "Yes." May I give up "Music," and
    take up "Sausages for breakfast" instead?</p>

terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
